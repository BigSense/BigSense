 *
 *  This file adds basic labels for major time zones to the Any+Time(TM)
 *  JavaScript Library.  Time zone support is extremely complicated, and
 *  ECMA-262 (JavaScript) provides little support.  Developers are expected
 *  to tailor this file to meet their needs, mostly by removing lines that
 *  are not required by their users, and/or by removing either abbreviated
 *  (before double-dash) or long (after double-dash) names from the strings.
 *  
 *  Note that there is no automatic detection of daylight savings time
 *  (AKA summer time), due to lack of support in JavaScript and the 
 *  time-prohibitive complexity of attempting such support in code.
 *  If you want to take a stab at it, let me know; if you want to pay me
 *  large sums of money to add it, again, let me know. :-p
 *  
 *  This file should be included AFTER anytime.js (or anytimec.js) in any
 *  HTML page that requires it.

//  AnyTime.utcLabel is an array of arrays, indexed by UTC offset IN MINUTES
//  (not hours-and-minutes).  This is used by AnyTime.Converter to display
//  time zone labels when the "%@" format specifier is used.  It is also used
//  by AnyTime.widget() to determine which time zone labels to offer as valid
//  choices when a user attempts to change the time zone.  NOTE: Positive
//  indicies are NOT signed.
//
//  Each sub-array contains a series of strings, each of which is a label
//  for a time-zone having the corresponding UTC offset.  The first string in
//  each sub-array is the default label for that UTC offset (the one used by
//  AnyTime.Converter.format() if utcFormatOffsetSubIndex is not specified and
//  setUtcFormatOffsetSubIndex() is not called.
